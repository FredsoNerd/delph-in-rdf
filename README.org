#+title: DELPH-IN formats in RDF

This repository is a temporary place to discuss how DELPH-IN formats
can be represented in RDF.

See file:1.org for one initial example of EDS representation.

This can be consider a continuation of some discussion started in
[[http://moin.delph-in.net/WeSearch/Rdf]].
